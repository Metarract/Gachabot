# Gachabot

## Description

A barebones Twitch Bot featuring a random string generator that pulls from local lists and plugs the value into a customizable string template

## Getting Started

### VS Code

#### Extensions

Just what I use, do whatever you want obviously but while this is in active development I'm going to be enforcing my personal formatting rules, these should help somewhat with that

- [C#](vscode:extension/ms-dotnettools.csharp)
- [C# Dev Kit](vscode:extension/ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
  - These two extensions kind of suck BUT they offer in-editor linting options which I desperately need as someone who is new to C#
  - This is going to install their [Intellicode for C# Dev Kit](vscode:extension/ms-dotnettools.vscodeintellicode-csharp) extension as well, which offers up AI code suggestions for tab completion. I find it incredibly annoying and it tends to get in the way of my normal workflow, but if you like it obviously feel free; just wanted to note it here so you know where to disable it if you wish to
- [EditorConfig for VS Code](vscode:extension/EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
  - Paired up with the previous two extensions to set some formatting options
  - I've simply grabbed the MS template from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/code-style-rule-options#example-editorconfig-file) and made some additions/modifications that are personal preferences
  - Probably gonna change as I move through things and learn more, but it's a bit daunting as it stands
